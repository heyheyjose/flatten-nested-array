###### Nested Arrays

This bit of code flattens arbitrarily nested arrays of arrays. In `index.js` you will see a couple of approaches for handling these types of arrays, with some commentary weighing the pros and cons of each approach.

To get started and run the test cases:
```
npm i (install dependencies)
node index.js (to run the code)
npm test (to run the tests)
```
